# Evolution of the Computer and the Binary System  

This document is part of my **Software Engineering Fundamentals certification at Platzi**.  
It summarizes the evolution of the computer and the importance of the binary system, considered the root of everything we know today in technology.

## Evolution of the Computer  

Behind every device we use so naturally (smartphones, smartwatches, quantum and scientific supercomputers) lies a fascinating historical journey:  

1. **Rudimentary Tools**  
   - Created by humans to solve simple operations and make daily life easier.  

2. **Industrial Gears**  
   - Machines powered by the mechanical revolution and the steam engine.  

3. **The Era of Electricity**  
   - The birth of modern calculating machines.  

4. **Internet and Miniaturization**  
   - Transformation into personal, mobile, and quantum computers‚Äîpillars of human development and promises of technological progress.

## The Binary System  

Beyond the linear history, what truly impacted me is the brutal simplicity upon which all computing power rests: **the binary system**.  

- Everything we see on a screen (images, letters, music, videos, video games, AI algorithms) is reduced to combinations of just two symbols: **0 and 1**.  
- With only two digits, the binary system can represent absolutely everything.  

**Example:**  
- The letter **‚ÄúA‚Äù** becomes: 01000001  

This pattern of bits, invisible to human eyes, comes alive as information. For the machine, it is not a letter, but a sequence of electrical impulses turning on and off in perfect synchrony.

## Reflection  

The computer is, in essence, a **translator between the human world and the language of electricity**.  
Just as every solid professional career requires firm foundations, all modern technology rests on this seemingly simple binary code‚Äîsupported by a process of **complex and profound intelligence**.
